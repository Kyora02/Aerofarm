# Aerofarm - Prototype Version

The repository below is our work in progress for AEROFARM, an app that connects to IoT devices for automated plant maintenance in aeroponic systems, which are more water-efficient, soil-free, and pesticide-free than conventional agriculture. Our app allows users to add new plants, scan devices, and customize settings for optimal growth conditions. Our AI monitors and adjusts the parameters and logs the activities. Our app also shows the status of the devices and their power consumption. We plan to use Flutter, Google Cloud AI, Gemini, Firebase, and solar panels to build a multiplatform, eco-friendly, and scalable app that supports sustainable development.
